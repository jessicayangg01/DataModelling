# R Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my R Data Science Portfolio! This repository is a comprehensive compilation of my data science projects, all developed using the R programming language. From predictive regression models to decision trees and beyond, you'll find a diverse array of data-driven solutions here.

## Key Highlights

- **Regression Analysis:** Dive into projects where I've used linear, logistic, and other regression techniques to predict and model data.

- **Decision Trees:** Discover how decision tree algorithms have been applied to solve classification and regression problems.

- **Data Visualization:** Explore visually engaging plots and charts that make complex data easy to understand.

- **Feature Engineering:** Learn about the process of selecting and transforming data features to improve model performance.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Understand the importance of data cleaning, transformation, and normalization in the data science workflow.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Explore projects that delve into statistical hypothesis testing and analysis.

- **R Packages:** Some projects may include custom R packages or functions for specific data science tasks.

## How to Use

Feel free to examine the code, read through project descriptions, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or opportunities for collaboration. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable, and I'm always eager to expand my skills and knowledge in the R data science realm.
